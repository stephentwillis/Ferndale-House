				<h3>Examinations</h3>
				
				<h5>
    			Before advising you about any treatment you might be seeking, it is important that we build up a picture of the condition of your mouth.
				<br /><br />
				A full dental examination well show how healthy your mouth is, and reveal any problems.
				<br /><br />
				As well as looking in your mouth, we will ask you some questions such as:
				</h5>
				<ul class="contenttext_alt">
					<li>Why you&rsquo;ve come for an examination</li>
					<li>Any problems you&rsquo;ve noticed (such as pain or sensitivity)</li>
					<li>Your general health including any medicines you might be taking</li>
					<li>Your diet</li>
					<li>How you clean your teeth</li>
					<li>Tobacco and alcohol use</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h5>
				We will:
				</h5>
				<ul class="contenttext_alt"> 
					<li>Examine your face and neck to see that they are healthy</li>
					<li>Often feel under your jaw</li>
					<li>Examine the lining of your mouth, tongue, cheeks and lips, as well as the roof of your mouth</li>
					<li>Look at your teeth and gums to see whether they are healthy or whether there are signs of decay, damage or gum disease</li>
				</ul>
				
				<br />
