				<h3>Patient Care</h3>
		
				<p>	
				The decision to enhance your smile is a personal one. A beautiful smile improves your confidence, in both personal and professional life. 
				Even a subtle change can improve the appearance.
				<br /><br />
				Hold a mirror in front of you and take a moment to evaluate your smile. Are you happy with what you see? Are you happy with the general smile, shape, colour or gaps between teeth? Please ask us what we can do for you to improve your smile.
				<br /><br />
Call us now on 01246 232634 or send for a welcome pack by emailing <a href="mailto:enquiries@ferndaledental.co.uk">enquiries@ferndaledental.co.uk</a> with your name, address and telephone number and the reference &lsquo;Patient care&rsquo;
