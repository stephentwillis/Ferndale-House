				<h3>Sedation Treatments</h3>
				
				<p>
				Although general anaesthetics are no longer permitted in General Practice, some people prefer not to be so aware of their surroundings while treatment is taking place. This is usually achieved by an injection in the arm or back of the hand, or by breathing 'happy air' through a small nasal hood. If you think you might find this helpful, please ask your dentist. The most appropriate technique will be chosen following a proper discussion of your requirements.
				<br /><br />
				Come and meet us to chat about sedation for your dentistry by calling us on 01246 232634 or send for a welcome pack by emailing <a href="mailto:enquiries@ferndaledental.co.uk">enquiries@ferndaledental.co.uk</a> with your name, address and telephone number and the reference &lsquo;Sedation&rsquo;
