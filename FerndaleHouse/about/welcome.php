				<h3>If you are a new patient, we would like to take this opportunity of welcoming you to our practice...</h3>
				
				<h5>Dental Care</h5>
				<p>
				It is our practice philosophy to promote dental health at all times. We therefore recommend regular check-ups. This will also help to keep down 				the cost of your treatment. Of course, you may already attend regularly, in which case you are probably fully aware of the importance of dental health and your dental appearance. 
				</p>
				
                <br /><br />
                
				<h5>Special Services</h5>
				
                <h6>In addition to routine treatment, we also offer:</h6>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>An orthodontic service and routine screening for children</li>
						<li>Dental Hygienist service</li>
						<li>Fissure sealing</li>
						<li>Sports mouth-guards</li>
						<li>Splint therapy for problem headaches</li>
					</ul>
                    
				<br /><br />
                    
				<h5>Anxious?</h5> 
				<p>
				Some people feel a deep-seated anxiety about dentistry. We understand. 
				<br />
				For many years we have offered a variety of techniques to help people overcome their fears. Please let us know and we will do every thing we 				can to help. 
				</p>
                
                <br /><br />
                
				<h5>Appointments</h5>
				<p> 
				We always try to see patients at the appointed time. If you are kept waiting, there is normally a good reason. Please be patient. If you have 				to cancel an appointment, please try to give us at least 24 hours notice. This enables us to make alternative arrangements perhaps to see 					someone in pain. It is practice policy normally to charge for broken appointments, or cancellations at very short notice. 
				</p>
                
                <br /><br />
                
				<h5>Keep us informed</h5> 
				<p>
				You will be asked about tablets or medicines you are taking. Please make a note of their names and tell us about them when you attend. If you 				change address or telephone number, please let us know. This helps to keep our records up to date and our recall system efficient. 
				</p>
                
                <br /><br />
				
                <h5>Disabled?</h5> 
				<p>
				If stairs present a problem, please make this clear when you book your appointment and our reception staff will arrange for you to be seen in 				one of our ground floor surgeries. A ramp for is available for the front steps. There are no disabled toilet facilities at present.
				</p>
                
                <br /><br />
                
				<h5>Improving our service</h5>

				<br /><br />
