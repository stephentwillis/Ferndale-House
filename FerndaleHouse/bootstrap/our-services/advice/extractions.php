						    <li>Do not rinse for 24 hours. Your saliva may be blood stained. You may wish to spit this away, but do not rinse.</li>
						    <li>Be prepared with your usual type of pain relief. Whatever you would normally take for headaches should be sufficient.</li>
						    <li>If you are worried that the socket seems to be bleeding. Roll up a small clean handkerchief, place it where the tooth was, and bite together for 10 to 15 minutes whilst sitting in a chair.</li>
						    <li>Take it easy for the rest of the day. Avoid strenuous exercise and alcohol because they make bleeding more likely. Smoking is likely to delay the healing.</li>
						    <li>Take care when eating. While you are numb it is very easy to bite your lip or cheek without realising.</li>
						    <li>After 24 hours you might find it helpful to bathe the area with warm salty water (one teaspoon of salt to a tumbler of warm water)</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>
						    If, after a couple of days, the pain seems to be getting worse rather than better, or if you are at all worried, please contact the surgery.
						    If you have had a new denture fitted immediately following an extractions, please follow the instructions given to you very carefully. This is the best was to promote healing and ensure the best possible comfort in the shortest possible time.
