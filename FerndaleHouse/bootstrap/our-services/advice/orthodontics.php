					    <h5>Why bother?</h5>
					    <p>
						    Braces are provided to make crooked teeth straight. This improves the smile, makes cleaning easier and may improve function. However, unless they are looked after very carefully, appliances collect plaque very readily. This can easily lead to decay.
					 	</p>
					 	<p>   
						    There are lots of questions you need to answer/think about before deciding to go ahead with orthodontic treatment:
					    </p>
				    </div>
				 	<div class="content-block">   
						<h5>Oral Hygiene</h5>
					    <p>
						    Are you prepared to spend at least 30 minutes daily, cleaning your teeth in the morning, after tea and before bed?
						    <br />
						    Are you able to attend for frequent adjustments? 
						</p>
						<p>
						    Routine visits are booked to adjust your appliance every 4 to 8 weeks. We often find that extra visits are necessary for patients with fixed appliances, especially early in treatment. Our last appointment for adjusting fixed appliances is 4:30pm, and for removable appliances is 4:45pm.
						</p>
						<p>
						    It will sometimes be necessary to take time off school.
						</p>
						<p>
						    It is practice policy to charge for failed appointments.
						</p>
						<p>
					    	Do you have the necessary determination?
						</p>
						<p>
						    Appliances will make your teeth ache. This will sometimes need painkillers.
						</p>
						<p>
						    Wearing braces requires a soft food diet. In order to prevent damage to both your teeth and the appliance you will need to avoid the following:
					    </p>
						    
					    <ul class="list"> 
							<li>Toffees, boiled sweets, chewing gum, chocolate bars etc</li>    
					   		<li>Fizzy drinks including diet drinks and excessive amounts of fruit juice</li>   
					    	<li>Hard foods which might damage the brace, such as crunchy apples, crusty bread etc.</li>
					    </ul>						    
					</div> 
					<div class="content-block">	    
					    <h5>Removable or fixed?</h5>
					    <p>
					    Each kind of brace is used for different situations. It is not normally possible to use a removable appliance if a fixed one is required.
					    </p>
					    
					    <br /> <br /> 
					    
					    <h5>Where do we go from here?</h5>
					    <p>
						    When you have decided to go ahead with treatment, we will need to ensure that your brushing is going to be adequate. Visits will be arranged with one of our Oral Health Educators until your plaque score is below 10%. 
					 	</p>
				 		<p>
					 		Then we will need a 30 minute appointments to collect start information including impressions for study models, X-rays if needed, and photographs.
						</p>
						<p>
						    We will then contact you to make arrangements to start fitting the brace.
						    Sometimes we need more impressions if parts of your brace have to be made in the laboratory.
					    </p>
				    </div>
					<div class="content-block">						    
					    <h5>For Fixed appliances:</h5>
					    <p>
						    There will usually be three visits close together:
						    <br />
						    Session 1 - 5 Minutes to place little wedges between your back teeth. Then 2-3 days later:
						    <br />
						    Session 2 - 30 minutes to place silver rings round your back teeth. Then 1-3 weeks later:
						    <br />
						    Session 3 - 45 minutes to glue all the other little pieces on.
						 </p>
						 <p>
						    If extractions are necessary, these are usually carried out by your own dentist. The timing varies between patients and will be explained to you.
					    </p>
				    </div>
					<div class="content-block">					    
					    <h5>What if my brace breaks during treatment?</h5>
					    <p>
					    	You will need to contact us. We will see you as soon as possible. If your next routine appointment is only a few days away, we might suggest sorting it out then. Repeated breakages will slow treatment down. Generally, every time the brace is broken, 1-2 months is added to the treatment time. If you break the brace repeatedly, treatment may be stopped, leaving your teeth in a worse position than when you started.
					    </p>
				    </div>
			    	<div class="content-block">
					    <h5>After Treatment</h5>
					    <p>
					    	Your teeth will try to return to their original position. To prevent this, you will be fitted with retaining appliances. These are usually worn full time at first and eventually worn part time. Some relapse of the lower front teeth usually happens. Your treatment is planned to minimise this. Sometimes, fixed retainers are recommended to be worn long-term.
