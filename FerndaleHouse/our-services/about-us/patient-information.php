			                            It is our practice philosophy to promote dental health at all times. We therefore recommend regular check-ups. This will also help to keep down the cost of your treatment. Of course, you may already attend regularly, in which case you are probably fully aware of the importance of dental health and your dental appearance.

			                            We always try to see patients at the appointed time. If you are kept waiting, there is normally a good reason. Please be patient. If you have to cancel an appointment, please try to give us at least 24 hours notice. This enables us to make alternative arrangements perhaps to see someone in pain. It is practice policy normally to charge for broken appointments, or cancellations at very short notice.
