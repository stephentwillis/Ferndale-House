				<h3>Periodontal Treatments...</h3>
				
				<p>
			    Most patients think that dentists are only interested in teeth. However, it has long been understood by the profession that healthy teeth are only useful if supported by healthy gums.
			    <br /><br />
			    Gum disease causes more loss of teeth in adults than decay.
			    <br /><br />
			    Although our academic understanding of the causes and treatments of periodontal conditions is still improving, two factors are well documented:
				<br /><br />
			    1 Move all the plaque every time you brush.
				<br /><br />
			    Ultimately periodontal disease is caused by toxins from plaque processing sugary foods. If there was no plaque, there would be no gum disease.
				<br /><br />
			    2 Smoking enhances the effect of the toxins.
				<br /><br />
			    Ferndale House Dental practice is delighted to have the services of a dental hygienist who will advise on correct brushing techniques, as well as being able to provide a range of other services.
